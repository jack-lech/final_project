					Final Project
				</h1>
				<p>
					Hello all, this is my final project for my Python Ceritificate at UCSD. Building a website has been a dream of mine for many years and I am proud to have made it a reality. A special thanks to my professors who guided me along the way, and a greater thanks to the friends and family that supported me through this certificate. Below is a README explaining the build and implementation of features. Enjoy.

                </h3>
                <p>If you are just looking to dive right in, go ahead and start navigating the links in the navbar at the top of the screen or the nav items in the hamburger menu if you are on mobile.</p>

                <h4>
                    Weather API
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Weather API is a simple API call to <a href="https://openweathermap.org">OpenWeather</a>. The API call iterates through a list of city names and dynamically builds a dictionary of information. This dictionary is then used to dynamically generate a table in the HTML.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Forum
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Forum page is a simple forum that allows users to enter a name and message. This information is then entered into a SQLITE database and returned on the webpage in descending order based on most recent. Currently, you need to navigate away from the page in order to make a post and click a link to return. Going forward with this project I would like to learn the proper JavaScript and AJAX calls to have this happen on the same page.

                    Backend
                </h3>
                <p>This site is built using Django version 3.0.14 and Python version 3.8.9. It is hosted server provided by <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>
                    The database utilized is a SQLITE database. This database is handling the posts made to the forum page. The API calls for the weather application are being handled by the Python REQUESTS module. The contact form was generated by the built in Django forms module and then modified. 
                </p>

                    Frontend
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The frontend of this site is utlizing Django HTML syntax to import a base.HTML file that is linked to all other pages. This base file has all required links, the navigation bar, and the footer. To style the website, I am using Bootstrap 5 and some custom CSS to make small modifications.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Graphic Design
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I designed the logo in the top left of the page using Adobe Illustrator.
